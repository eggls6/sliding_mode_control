# Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems

## Sliding Mode Control for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems I
The first notebook demonstrates Sliding Mode Control as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_mode_control with the mathematical pendulum system. The aim is to drive the trajectory to the unstable equilibrium point, i.e. to keep the pendulum upright.

## Sliding Mode Control for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems II
The second notebook demonstrates Sliding Mode Control as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_mode_control with the mathematical pendulum system, where the aim is to drive an offset trajectory represented by a variational vector to a nominal trajectory through controling the variational equations.
